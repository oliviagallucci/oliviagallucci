I am an offensive security engineer, open source contributor, and freedom culture advocate. 

In addition, I am an undergraduate student at the Rochester Institute of Technology, double-majoring in _Cybersecurity_ and _Computer Science_, and minoring in _Open Source Software and Free(dom) Culture_. I rank in the top 1% of my degree program, and plan to graduate in May 2025. 

In my spare time, I enjoy sailing, reading, and blogging. 

<!--
## Free(dom) Software 
> "Free software" means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the ***users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software***. Thus, "free software" is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, you should think of "free" as in "free speech," not as in "free beer." We sometimes call it "libre software," borrowing the French or Spanish word for "free" as in freedom, to show we do not mean the software is gratis.
> 
> You may have paid money to get copies of a free program, or you may have obtained copies at no charge. But regardless of how you got your copies, you always have the freedom to copy and change the software, even to sell copies.
>
> A program is free software if the program's users have the ***four essential freedoms***:
>> - The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
>> 
>> - The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
>> 
>> - The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
>> 
>> - The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
